 I Ryan Peach maintain all rights to commercialize this code. You may not
 release this code or any subset of this code in any way that competes with this
 app.

I have however provided the code for anyone to download for personal
modification and use (meaning if you are programmer, you can get the app for
free), education, and upstream contributions. If you make a contribution, I will
seriously consider putting it in the main app. I am not a Swift developer so any
help is greatly appreciated. And if you make good enough contributions we can
compromise profit sharing or payment.
