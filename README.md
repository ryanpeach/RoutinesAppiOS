# RoutinesAppiOS

Inspired by Fabulous on the App Store this is a simple app anyone can sideload that can categorize and time your routines by section and subsection (not just time of day).

Written entirely in SwiftUI.

First attempt using Swift or making an iOS app.

Last time I checked, it works.
