# RoutinesAppiOS

This is a non open-source (privately liscensed) iOS app provided for example purposes only.

Inspired by Fabulous on the App Store this is a simple app anyone can sideload that can categorize and time your routines by section and subsection (not just time of day).

Written entirely in SwiftUI. Give it a try, learn from it, just don't sell it to anyone.
